Xresources Color Scheme
-----------------------

http://github.com/solarized/xresources

Use of color schemes with X Windows is heavily dependent upon one's local
configuration. Please see the fine [Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xresources) for guidance on the use of .Xresources and related files.

Further information on the .Xresources file and its place in the X Window
System can of course be found on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_resources).

Local changes in this repo
--------------------------

- Color 0 (was: black) can be used for emphasized text (in dark _and_ light).
- Color 7 (was: white) can be used for comments (in dark _and_ light).
- Bold colors are the same as non-bold colors.
